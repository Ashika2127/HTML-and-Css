      <li>
        Flour: Flour provides the dough structure. All-purpose flour is best for
        these cinnamon rolls. You could also use bread flour—the rolls will be
        chewier.
      </li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Whole milk</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>

        The first step is to mix your dry ingredients together in a big bowl and
        this includes the flour, sugar, and salt. After that, warm the milk and
        butter together, and then whisk in the yeast until it has dissolved.
        Then you know it can start working its magic in your dough!
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour this mixture over the dry ingredients, add the egg and then mix
        everything together. You do not need a stand mixer for this recipe,
        though you could certainly use one if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer dough to your work surface (below, left), and then knead by
        hand for 3 minutes until a soft dough forms (below, right).
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the dough rest for 10 minutes as you prepare the filling—this gives
        the dough’s gluten a chance to settle and relax, which will make rolling
        out much easier.
      </li>

        These easy cinnamon rolls from scratch are completely irresistible and
        they take half the time. If you’re looking for that perfect cinnamon
        roll recipe that doesn’t require 4+ hours, this is the winner.
